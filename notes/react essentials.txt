📌 Why Are Components Useful?
- Reusability: You can create a button once and use it everywhere without writing the same code again.
- Easy to Understand: If your code is divided into small pieces (components), it’s much easier to understand and work with.
- Easy to Update: If you want to change the header design, you only change it in one place, and it updates everywhere.
- Organized Code: Your code is cleaner and more organized. Each component does only one thing.
- Better Performance: Only the components that need to update will change, not the whole page.

📌 Understanding Files
🔹index.html is responsible for diplaying content, and it contains index.jsx file
🔹 index.jsx file importing App.jsx file , and index.jsx file used App as JXS code (<App/>)
   and this index.jsx file act as main entry point of our App
   and createRoot and render method are responsible for rendring a single root component
🔹 App.jsx file contains all contents of our website

📌Component Function -> must starts with uppercase Character and shoud have return statement

📌How React handles components ?
- if we inspect our web we see index.html file,having script tag which have index.jsx that transformed into code that run in browser  
- (see index.jsx) 
- the App Component may contain many nested component as needed (App -> 1. Header 2. SideBar 3. Product 4. Footer)
   and are analyzed by React, and React combines all JSX code to generate overall DOM
- these custom components are not showing in actual rendered DOM , there are default html elements like (<header></header>)

📌Component -> A component is like a building block for web pages. You make it once and use it anywhere you want. 
              It makes development faster and more organized. 
These are 2 types 1.Build-in Components  2. Custom Components
1.Build-in Components -> lower case like div , img 
2. Custom Components -> UpperCase like App, Header, SideBar

📌Props :
- Props (short for "properties") are a way to pass data from one component to another, 
- typically from a parent component to a child component. 
- They are read-only and cannot be modified by the child component.
